        <p>
          This service logs all request and response data. Do not use it with
          sensitive information, authentication tokens, or private API
          endpoints. This tool is meant for development and debugging only.

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-0 space-y-2">
            <li>Create a proxy endpoint for your target URL</li>
            <li>Send requests to your proxy URL instead of the target</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl mb-2">Under the hood</h2>
          <p>
            WorkerSpy uses a Cloudflare Worker that forwards requests to your
            target URL while logging all request and response data for
            inspection. All data is stored in a Cloudflare D1 database.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl mb-2">Security</h2>
          <p>
            Each proxy endpoint is protected with a unique token, but all
            request data is logged and viewable by anyone with the URL. Do not
            use for sensitive data or production traffic.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl mb-2">Supported features</h2>
          <p>
            All HTTP methods and content types should be supported. If your API
            can handle it, the proxy should be able to handle it.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl mb-2">Limits</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-0 space-y-2">
            <li>Request and response bodies are limited to 1MB in size</li>

              Proxies will expire after {PROXY_LINK_EXPIRY_DAYS} days and their
